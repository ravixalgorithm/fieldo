# Build Status — June 12, 2026 (updated after verification)

## Done (Phase 0 + inbox slice, uncommitted → now committed)

- **packages/types** — full `FormSchemaV1` types: 17 field types, logic rules, theme tokens, settings, event enums
- **packages/form-core** — zod schema (`parseFormSchema`), `evaluateLogic` (+ cycle lint), logic-aware `validateSubmission` (strips logic-hidden answers server-side), `extractEmail`, spam scoring (`scoreSubmission`: honeypot, time-trap, disposable email, link/keyword heuristics, configurable flag/reject thresholds)
- **packages/db** — Drizzle + better-sqlite3 (**v12 required**, v11 fails to build on Node 24). SQLite for local dev, schema mirrors PRD Postgres shape. DB file at `.data/fieldo.db`. Tables: forms, form_versions, submissions, partial_submissions, form_events
- **packages/renderer** — single `<FormRenderer>`: all field types, multi-step paging + progress, logic, inline validation, honeypot, event beacons (sendBeacon), debounced partial capture + visibilitychange abandon, modes live/preview/canvas, `--fieldo-*` CSS vars
- **apps/dashboard** (Next.js 14, port **3210**):
  - Public API: `GET /api/v1/forms/{id}/meta` (signed render token), `POST .../submit` (full PRD §5.3.9 pipeline: limits, rate-limit, spam score w/ silent reject, server re-validation, dedupe-by-email, partial cleanup), `POST .../partials`, `POST /api/v1/events`
  - Internal API: forms CRUD, publish (immutable version snapshot + repoint), submissions list/CSV/actions, field-level analytics (reach, dwell, refocus, error rate)
  - UI: forms list + contact template, JSON editor w/ live `<FormRenderer mode="preview">`, share/embed tab, inbox w/ spam folder + detail + recover/delete, analytics page, hosted `/f/[slug]` (SSR + `?embed=1`)
- No auth yet (single-user local). In-memory rate limit (Redis later). Worker/MCP/Framer component not started.

## Verification — DONE ✅

The earlier create-form failure was Next/webpack bundling better-sqlite3 (`bindings` lookup broke with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'indexOf')"). `serverComponentsExternalPackages` wasn't taking effect because better-sqlite3 wasn't resolvable from `apps/dashboard` under pnpm. Fixed by adding `better-sqlite3` as a direct dashboard dependency + explicit server webpack external in `next.config.mjs`.

Full e2e suite in `scripts/e2e-verify.sh` (run with dev server up: `bash scripts/e2e-verify.sh`) — all pass:
create → publish → meta/render-token → valid submit → logic-hidden-field injection stripped server-side → 422 on missing required → honeypot silent reject (fake 200, stored `rejected`) → dedupe-by-email 409 → stored statuses/email correct → analytics 200.

## Phase 3 embeds — DONE ✅ (June 12)

- **packages/react** (`@fieldo/react`) — `<FieldoForm id apiBaseUrl theme onSubmitted />`: fetches `/meta?supportedSchema=1`, renders shared `<FormRenderer>`; exports `fetchFormMeta`, re-exports `FormRenderer`
- **apps/component** — Framer code component `src/FieldoForm.tsx`: property controls (formId, dashboard-vs-custom theme with per-token overrides, advanced apiBaseUrl), `RenderTarget.canvas` → skeleton/no-tracking, live → full renderer, embedSource="framer". `pnpm build` (esbuild, ESM, externals react/framer) → dist 19.9 KB gz (budget 150). Typechecks (framer module shimmed in `src/framer.d.ts`)
- **embed.js** — `apps/dashboard/embed/embed.tsx` → `pnpm build:embed` → `public/embed.js` (IIFE, React inlined, 64.7 KB gz). `<script src=".../embed.js" data-form="frm_…" [data-api=origin]>` injects form after the script tag, embedSource="html"
- **Verified in a real headless browser**: embed.js on a foreign-origin page (port 8077) rendered, submitted, success message shown; stored submission status=complete, embedSource=html, spamScore=0. Test page: `scripts/embed-test/index.html` (form id hardcoded — recreate if DB reset)
- Not done from Phase 3: Marketplace submission (needs real Framer project), OG image gen, postMessage auto-height for iframe embed

## MCP server — DONE ✅ (June 12)

- **apps/mcp** (`@fieldo/mcp`) — stdio MCP server (`pnpm start`, needs dashboard on :3210; `FIELDO_API_URL` overrides). 31 tools across all PRD §5.3.8 groups: Library (workspaces/folders stubbed for single-user, list/get/search forms), Management (create incl. NL-description heuristic in `src/nl.ts`, field add/remove/update, set_logic, settings/theme merge, publish/unpublish/duplicate, delete w/ confirm guard), Submissions (list/get/export/partials/mark/delete w/ confirm), Analytics (form funnel, field funnel, heuristic friction insights, workspace aggregate), Developer (form API info, embed code for 5 targets, scaffold integration, test_submit through the real pipeline marked read, form status)
- New dashboard routes for it: `POST /api/forms/[id]/unpublish`, `POST /api/forms/[id]/duplicate`, `GET /api/forms/[id]/partials`
- **Verified** via `node scripts/mcp-verify.mjs` (real stdio JSON-RPC client): 19/19 incl. the headline recipe create_form(NL) → publish → generate_embed_code
- Deferred: OAuth (no auth in app yet — single-user local), AI-powered create_form (deterministic keyword heuristic for now), hosted remote endpoint

## NEXT STEP

1. Worker fan-out (email/webhook), AI form generation, builder UI
